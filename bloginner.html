        <h2>Drawing using augmented reality</h2>
        <p>I had some struggles to find the topic that I would like to write my blog post about. I won't lie, after I started taking this Full stack course
I had to face the fact that my knowledge of this giant tech world was at the very beginner level. Of course, like others, I use internet,
 smartphone, my work is mostly based online and I have some knowledge about cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence(I even watched West World TV series
and totally liked it) and some other tech topics.</br>
</br>I consider myself as a curious person and I like to know a lot about different things, so I started to build up my knowledge in the technology field. I spent some time
researching and reading different topics, it made me feel a little anxious ant totally
out of that - super smart humans world - until I accidentally found something
I felt related to.(At this point you should hear some cool drum intro
in the back of your head).</br>
This genius thing for me is — "Drawing using augmented reality". Why I think it's cool? Because I draw/paint
since I can remember myself.
</br>
</br>I tried out a lot of different techniques, from pencil sketching to digital drawing with tablet and this new innovative
kind of drawing is very different from everything
I knew before. Also, I work in creative field as a graphic designer-illustrator, so I feel
that this new way of drawing and learning, one day, will become a big game changer.
</br>
</br>
Drawing using augmented reality app is called SKETCHAR.</br>
</br>How did it all started?</br>
As they write on their webpage sketchar.tech the idea was born in 2012. When working, artist Andrey was dreaming about an AR-app to make the process of drawing easier.
Andrey and his friend Alexander first met ten years ago.
In 2011, they created their first company — a mobile technology for publishers. Their background and experience in
tech and art enabled a new chapter to
emerge — SketchAR.
</br>
</br>For who this app is created for?
</br>For every person who would like to draw, for those who have always wanted, but have never been able to draw.
Also, the app is designed for professional
artists as a simple and convenient way to trace sketches onto any desired surface (e.g., canvas, wall, etc.).
</br>
</br>How it works?
</br>
</br>1. You can draw on paper — just hold up your phone and watch as a virtual image appear on top of your surroundings.
</br>
</br>2. Walls — You can paint on a wall using smartphones with ARKit and ARCore. Or if you have smartphones with Tango(Lenovo Phab2Pro or Asus ZenPhone AR) You can draw on wall too.
</br>
</br>3. AR-glasses — Microsoft HoloLens is the first fully self-contained, holographic computer enabling you to interact with high‑definition holograms in your world.
</br>


</br>Another thing about SKETCHAR that makes me excited is that they're based in Vilnius TechPark, here in Lithuania. I always find myself feeling joyful
when I hear that something
that was created in Lithuania have a chance to astonish the world.

</br>SKETCHAR app was elected in "The WEBBY AWARDS WINNER 2018" in the categories "Best Use of Augmented Reality".

</br>App also won first place in "Start-up Lithuania" as a most promising tech startup from Lithuania 2017. And that's not all, you can check all the prizes that they won in
their webpage.

</br>And if you would like to read more about SKETCHAR and drawing using augmented reality you can check their blog:
medium.com/sketcher


</br>
</br>I'm looking forward to try this app ASAP, especially drawing murals, because the way to draw them using projector was not very convenient and had some
issues.

</br>As we stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. I can see that with the right management
and investment, apps like this could be integrated in to the learning processes in schools
or after school activities.
Although I don't think they should change real tutors because an important part of teaching-learning process is the human connection and communication.
