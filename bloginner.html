        <h2>Smart City Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>In 1900 just 14 percent of people on earth lived in cities but by 2008 half the world’s population lived in urban areas, and the rate continues to grow.
        </br>
        One huge source of raw data that AI pattern recognition technology is making significantly more manageable is video and photos. NVIDIA predicts that by 2020 there will be 1 billion cameras deployed on government property, infrastructure, and on commercial buildings.
        </br>
        That is far more raw data than could ever be viewed, processed, or analyzed by humans. This is why only a small fraction of cameras are ever actively monitored by people. This is where deep learning comes in. It can count vehicles and pedestrians. It can read license plates and recognize faces. It can track the speed and movements of millions of vehicles to establish patterns. It can process the huge volume of satellite data to count cars in a parking lot or track road use.
        </br>
        A straightforward application of machine processing video for cities is license plate recognition (LPR), which is used in numerous ways. For example, since 2014 the City of Galveston has been using the company gtechna’s Pay by Plate number parking system. Instead of traditional analog meters, people can pay by phone and LPR technology verifies who is parked legally.
        </br>
        The system did not require installing any new infrastructure at the city’s historic Seawall, and it reduced deployment costs while preserving the area’s aesthetic. The company claims in the first year the system produced $700,000 in new revenue and the city saw an 80% increase in collection rates.
        </br>
        </br>
        Smart Parking Garages
        </br>
        VIMOC is using AI to make parking easier in Redwood City. The company installed vehicle detection and reporting in two of the city’s large parking garages. The amount of available parking is displayed outside the garages on large LED signs and shared with an open platform for use by app developers. It provides the immediate benefit letting individuals know where parking is available, and in the long term, the wealth of data collected will allow the city to make planning and pricing decisions.

        </br>
        Adaptive Signal Control Technology allows traffic lights to change their timing based on real time data.  According to the Department of Transportation (DOT), “On average [Adaptive Signal Control Technology] improves travel time by more than 10 percent. In areas with particularly outdated signal timing, improvements can be 50 percent or more.” Given that traffic congestion costs the country $87.2 billion in wasted fuel and productivity (according the the DOT), there is a strong reason why numerous cities and companies are deploying this technology around the country.
        </br>
        As a result, the potential for growth for these systems and the companies that make them is significant. It is not surprising, then, that numerous large companies (Siemens, Microsoft, Hitachi, others) have put an increased focus on smart city technology.

        <h2>Drawing using augmented reality</h2>
        <p>I had some struggles to find the topic that I would like to write my blog post about. I won't lie, after I started taking this Full stack course
I had to face the fact that my knowledge of this giant tech world was at the very beginner level. Of course, like others, I use internet,
 smartphone, my work is mostly based online and I have some knowledge about cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence(I even watched West World TV series
and totally liked it) and some other tech topics.</br>
</br>I consider myself as a curious person and I like to know a lot about different things, so I started to build up my knowledge in the technology field. I spent some time
researching and reading different topics, it made me feel a little anxious ant totally
out of that - super smart humans world - until I accidentally found something
I felt related to.(At this point you should hear some cool drum intro
in the back of your head).</br>
This genius thing for me is — "Drawing using augmented reality". Why I think it's cool? Because I draw/paint
since I can remember myself.
</br>
</br>I tried out a lot of different techniques, from pencil sketching to digital drawing with tablet and this new innovative
kind of drawing is very different from everything
I knew before. Also, I work in creative field as a graphic designer-illustrator, so I feel
that this new way of drawing and learning, one day, will become a big game changer.
</br>
</br>
Drawing using augmented reality app is called SKETCHAR.</br>
</br>How did it all started?</br>
As they write on their webpage sketchar.tech the idea was born in 2012. When working, artist Andrey was dreaming about an AR-app to make the process of drawing easier.
Andrey and his friend Alexander first met ten years ago.
In 2011, they created their first company — a mobile technology for publishers. Their background and experience in
tech and art enabled a new chapter to
emerge — SketchAR.
</br>
</br>For who this app is created for?
</br>For every person who would like to draw, for those who have always wanted, but have never been able to draw.
Also, the app is designed for professional
artists as a simple and convenient way to trace sketches onto any desired surface (e.g., canvas, wall, etc.).
</br>
</br>How it works?
</br>
</br>1. You can draw on paper — just hold up your phone and watch as a virtual image appear on top of your surroundings.
</br>
</br>2. Walls — You can paint on a wall using smartphones with ARKit and ARCore. Or if you have smartphones with Tango(Lenovo Phab2Pro or Asus ZenPhone AR) You can draw on wall too.
</br>
</br>3. AR-glasses — Microsoft HoloLens is the first fully self-contained, holographic computer enabling you to interact with high‑definition holograms in your world.
</br>


</br>Another thing about SKETCHAR that makes me excited is that they're based in Vilnius TechPark, here in Lithuania. I always find myself feeling joyful
when I hear that something
that was created in Lithuania have a chance to astonish the world.

</br>SKETCHAR app was elected in "The WEBBY AWARDS WINNER 2018" in the categories "Best Use of Augmented Reality".

</br>App also won first place in "Start-up Lithuania" as a most promising tech startup from Lithuania 2017. And that's not all, you can check all the prizes that they won in
their webpage.

</br>And if you would like to read more about SKETCHAR and drawing using augmented reality you can check their blog:
medium.com/sketcher


</br>
</br>I'm looking forward to try this app ASAP, especially drawing murals, because the way to draw them using projector was not very convenient and had some
issues.

</br>As we stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. I can see that with the right management
and investment, apps like this could be integrated in to the learning processes in schools
or after school activities.
Although I don't think they should change real tutors because an important part of teaching-learning process is the human connection and communication.
