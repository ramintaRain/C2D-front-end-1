        <h2>A smarter smart city</h2>
        <p>An ambitious project by Alphabet subsidiary Sidewalk Labs could reshape how we live, work, and play in urban neighborhoods.
				</br>
				The neighborhood, called Quayside, is Sidewalk’s first big project. It will start life on a 12-acre plot mostly owned by Waterfront Toronto—a local development agency founded by Canada’s federal, provincial, and municipal governments—and is expected to house an estimated 5,000 people. Later development could expand to a neighboring 700-plus-acre parcel of industrial waterfront and involve tens of thousands of residents. “All of our thinking and decisions on Quayside are shaped by the question ‘What do 21st-century technologies enable us to do better?’” says Aggarwala.
				</br>
				Driverless cars will have a big role. Sidewalk assumes they will navigate more precisely and obey traffic laws more consistently than human drivers, so it wants to put narrower lanes in Quayside and carve out more room for sidewalks and parks. In theory, using shared self-driving vehicles will mean that fewer people need to own cars, saving families a projected $6,000 a year.
				</br>
				Sensing and monitoring public activity accurately and frequently will be key. Running autonomous buses on city streets requires knowing when to change lights and other signals to give cyclists and pedestrians priority.
				</br>
				Sidewalk Labs says the sensor information would also support long-term planning. The data would fuel a virtual model of Quayside, which urban planners could use to test infrastructure changes quickly, at low cost, and without bothering residents. It could also be stored in a shared repository that entrepreneurs and companies could draw on to make their own products and services for Quayside.
				</br>
				Sidewalk thinks of smart cities as being rather like smartphones. It sees itself as a platform provider responsible for offering basic tools (from software that identifies available parking spots to location-based services monitoring the exact position of delivery robots), much as Google does with its smartphone operating system, Android. Details are still under discussion, but Sidewalk plans to let third parties access the data and technologies, just as developers can use Google’s and Apple’s software tools to craft apps.
				</br>
				One way Sidewalk Labs differs from Google and Android is the way it plans to make money. The startup is still figuring out its business model, but it has said it expects to license the technology it produces for Quayside to other cities, rather than compile consumer data and use it to sell ads. Still, many people are worried about privacy given the data Quayside plans to harvest. In recent months, Canadian newspapers and blogs have published a number of skeptical articles, including a list of more than 35 probing questions about Sidewalk Labs’ business model and data governance methods.
				</br>
				Most of the scrutiny relates to the company’s plan to install sensors across Quayside to measure everything from building occupancy to sewage flow rates to how often a public waste bin is used. The company is also devising a system that would give Quayside residents and workers a quick way to pay for things and gain access to services, similar to the way people can buy products off Amazon with a single click or get billed for Uber rides through an app.

        <h2>Smart City Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>In 1900 just 14 percent of people on earth lived in cities but by 2008 half the world’s population lived in urban areas, and the rate continues to grow.
        </br>
        One huge source of raw data that AI pattern recognition technology is making significantly more manageable is video and photos. NVIDIA predicts that by 2020 there will be 1 billion cameras deployed on government property, infrastructure, and on commercial buildings.
        </br>
        That is far more raw data than could ever be viewed, processed, or analyzed by humans. This is why only a small fraction of cameras are ever actively monitored by people. This is where deep learning comes in. It can count vehicles and pedestrians. It can read license plates and recognize faces. It can track the speed and movements of millions of vehicles to establish patterns. It can process the huge volume of satellite data to count cars in a parking lot or track road use.
        </br>
        A straightforward application of machine processing video for cities is license plate recognition (LPR), which is used in numerous ways. For example, since 2014 the City of Galveston has been using the company gtechna’s Pay by Plate number parking system. Instead of traditional analog meters, people can pay by phone and LPR technology verifies who is parked legally.
        </br>
        The system did not require installing any new infrastructure at the city’s historic Seawall, and it reduced deployment costs while preserving the area’s aesthetic. The company claims in the first year the system produced $700,000 in new revenue and the city saw an 80% increase in collection rates.
        </br>
        </br>
        Smart Parking Garages
        </br>
        VIMOC is using AI to make parking easier in Redwood City. The company installed vehicle detection and reporting in two of the city’s large parking garages. The amount of available parking is displayed outside the garages on large LED signs and shared with an open platform for use by app developers. It provides the immediate benefit letting individuals know where parking is available, and in the long term, the wealth of data collected will allow the city to make planning and pricing decisions.

        </br>
        Adaptive Signal Control Technology allows traffic lights to change their timing based on real time data.  According to the Department of Transportation (DOT), “On average [Adaptive Signal Control Technology] improves travel time by more than 10 percent. In areas with particularly outdated signal timing, improvements can be 50 percent or more.” Given that traffic congestion costs the country $87.2 billion in wasted fuel and productivity (according the the DOT), there is a strong reason why numerous cities and companies are deploying this technology around the country.
        </br>
        As a result, the potential for growth for these systems and the companies that make them is significant. It is not surprising, then, that numerous large companies (Siemens, Microsoft, Hitachi, others) have put an increased focus on smart city technology.

        <h2>Drawing using augmented reality</h2>
        <p>I had some struggles to find the topic that I would like to write my blog post about. I won't lie, after I started taking 
	this Full stack course I had to face the fact that my knowledge of this giant tech world was at the very beginner level. 
	Of course, like others, I use internet, smartphone, my work is mostly based online and I have some knowledge about 
	cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence(I even watched West World TV series and totally liked it) and some other tech topics.
	</br>

</br>I consider myself as a curious person and I like to know a lot about different things, so I started to build up my knowledge
in the technology field. I spent some time researching and reading different topics, it made me feel a little anxious ant totally
out of that - super smart humans world - until I accidentally found something I felt related to.(At this point you should hear 
some cool drum introin the back of your head).</br>
</br>
This genius thing for me is — "Drawing using augmented reality".</br>
Why I think it's cool? Because I draw/paint
since I can remember myself.
</br>
</br>I tried out a lot of different techniques, from pencil sketching to digital drawing with tablet and this new innovative
kind of drawing is very different from everything
I knew before. Also, I work in creative field as a graphic designer-illustrator, so I feel
that this new way of drawing and learning, one day, will become a big game changer.
</br>
</br>
Drawing using augmented reality app is called SKETCHAR.</br>
</br>How did it all started?</br>
As they write on their webpage sketchar.tech the idea was born in 2012. When working, artist Andrey was dreaming about an AR-app to make the process of drawing easier.
Andrey and his friend Alexander first met ten years ago.
In 2011, they created their first company — a mobile technology for publishers. Their background and experience in
tech and art enabled a new chapter to
emerge — SketchAR.
</br>
</br>For who this app is created for?
</br>For every person who would like to draw, for those who have always wanted, but have never been able to draw.
Also, the app is designed for professional
artists as a simple and convenient way to trace sketches onto any desired surface (e.g., canvas, wall, etc.).
</br>
</br>How it works?
</br>
</br>1. You can draw on paper — just hold up your phone and watch as a virtual image appear on top of your surroundings.
</br>
</br>2. Walls — You can paint on a wall using smartphones with ARKit and ARCore. Or if you have smartphones with Tango(Lenovo Phab2Pro or Asus ZenPhone AR) You can draw on wall too.
</br>
</br>3. AR-glasses — Microsoft HoloLens is the first fully self-contained, holographic computer enabling you to interact with high‑definition holograms in your world.
</br>


</br>Another thing about SKETCHAR that makes me excited is that they're based in Vilnius TechPark, here in Lithuania. I always find myself feeling joyful
when I hear that something
that was created in Lithuania have a chance to astonish the world.

</br>SKETCHAR app was elected in "The WEBBY AWARDS WINNER 2018" in the categories "Best Use of Augmented Reality".

</br>App also won first place in "Start-up Lithuania" as a most promising tech startup from Lithuania 2017. And that's not all, you can check all the prizes that they won in
their webpage.

</br>And if you would like to read more about SKETCHAR and drawing using augmented reality you can check their blog:
medium.com/sketcher


</br>
</br>I'm looking forward to try this app ASAP, especially drawing murals, because the way to draw them using projector was not very convenient and had some
issues.

</br>As we stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. I can see that with the right management
and investment, apps like this could be integrated in to the learning processes in schools
or after school activities.
Although I don't think they should change real tutors because an important part of teaching-learning process is the human connection and communication.
